Life is a gift that we are extremely lucky to experience. It's an enigma how a single cell divides and multiplies to form an organism that grows into us.

Human beings are the dominant species on this planet but most of us live a life no different from any other animal. Some amongst us who we call alphas tend to hold the power to control and modify the course of our lives.

How often do we know what we want from our lives?

Its important to always have a plan if you want a meaningful life. It's no different from having a business plan, you just need to understand that you are the most important entity in your life and if you can plan your life, everything around you will automatically fall in place.

So let me address the things that will convince you and also help you plan your life.

Why do you need to plan?

1. Gives you a sense of purpose
2. Be focused
3. Anticipate problems
4. Decrease likelihood of failures

How to make a plan?

1. Be honest
2. Outline things that you want to aim to achieve on personal, economical and social front.

Revisit and reinforce:

Improvise.

1. Your plans, most of them will not work but will definitely get modified as you move along. It's important to understand that the plans are not a golden rule, they are guiding principles and to have a plan if the recipe to succeed but it might have changed by the time you get to the goal post and also, the goal post might have changed but you got there or at least you tried which is what matters, doesn't it?
